Early in its mission, Curiosity's scientific tools found chemical and mineral evidence of past habitable environments on Mars. It continues to explore the rock record from a time when Mars could have been home to microbial life.","photos":[{"id":1228212,"sol":4102,"camera":{"id":20,"name":"FHAZ","rover_id":5,"full_name":"Front Hazard Avoidance

her planned 90-day mission, lasting over six years. Among her myriad discoveries, Spirit found evidence that Mars was once much wetter than it is today and helped scientists better understand the Martian wind. <br /><br />In May 2009, the rover became embedded in soft soil at a site called 'Troy' with only five working wheels to aid in the rescue effort. After months of testing and carefully planned maneuvers, NASA ended efforts to free the rover and eventually ended the mission on May 25, 2011.","photos":[{"id":296879,"sol":1302,"camera":{"id":29,"name":"NAVCAM","rover_id":7,"full_name":"Navigation

Planet in search of signs of ancient water. The rover explored the Martian terrain for almost 15 years, far outlasting her planned 90-day mission.<br /><br />After landing on Mars in 2004, Opportunity made a number of discoveries about the Red Planet including dramatic evidence that long ago at least one area of Mars stayed wet for an extended period and that conditions could have been suitable for sustaining microbial life.<br /><br /> The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June 2018. After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in the Mission Control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity Tuesday, February 13, 2019, to no avail. The solar-powered rover's final communication was received June 10. <br/><br/><span class='last_words'> Oppurtunity's last transmission was:<br/>\"My battery is low and it's getting

exploration of the Red Planet. A key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life.<br/><br/>Perseverance is investigating Jezero Crater – a region of Mars where the ancient environment may have been favorable for microbial life – probing the Martian rocks for evidence of past life. The rover carries an entirely new subsystem to collect and prepare Martian rocks and sediment samples that includes a coring drill on its arm and a rack of sample titanium tubes in its chassis. Throughout its exploration of the region, the rover will collect promising samples, sealing them are tubes and storing them in its chassis until Perseverance deposits them on the Martian surface to be retrieved by a future mission. Perseverance will likely create multiple “depots” later in the mission for this purpose. increases the likelihood that especially valuable samples will be accessible for retrieval. Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and bring them to Earth for in-depth analysis using powerful laboratory equipment too large to take to Mars.<br/><br>Two science instruments mounted on the rover’s robotic arm are used to search for signs of past life and determine where to collect samples by analyzing the chemical, mineral, physical, and organic characteristics of Martian rocks. On the rover’s mast, two science instruments provide high-resolution imaging and three types of spectroscopy for characterizing rocks and soil from a distance, also helping to determine which rock targets to explore up close.<br/><br/>The Perseverance rover used the same sky crane landing system as Curiosity, but with the ability to land in more challenging terrain with two enhancements, making more rugged sites eligible as safe landing candidates.","photos":[{"id":1228275,"sol":1067,"camera":{"id":33,"name":"EDL_RUCAM","rover_id":8,"full_name":"Rover Up-Look Camera"},"img_src":"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020-raw-images/pub/ods/surface/sol/01067/ids/edr/browse/edl/EUE_1067_0761655560_653ECM_N0501534EDLC09015_0010LUJ01_1200.jpg","earth_date":"2024-02-19","rover":{"id":8,"name":"Perseverance","landing_date":"2021-02-18","launch_date":"2020-07-30","status":"active","max_sol":1067,"max_date":"2024-02-19","total_photos":201171,"cameras":[{"name":"EDL_RUCAM","full_name":"Rover Up-Look Camera"},{"name":"EDL_DDCAM","full_name":"Descent Stage Down-Look Camera"},{"name":"EDL_PUCAM1","full_name":"Parachute Up-Look Camera A"},{"name":"EDL_PUCAM2","full_name":"Parachute Up-Look Camera B"},{"name":"NAVCAM_LEFT","full_name":"Navigation Camera -

Nicknamed for its avian shape, the Seagull Nebula is an emission nebula on the night sky that is vast, spanning an angle over five times the diameter of the full moon and over 200 light years.  The head of the nebula is catalogued as IC 2177, and the star cluster under its right wing is catalogued as NGC 2343. Consisting of mostly red-glowing hydrogen gas, the Seagull Nebula incorporates some dust lanes and is forming stars.  The peak over which this Seagull seems to soar occurs at Pinnacles National Park in California, USA.  The featured image is a composite of long exposure images of the background sky and short exposure images of the foreground, all taken consecutively with the same camera and from the same location.
